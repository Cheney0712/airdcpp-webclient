## Reporting a bug?

Please read https://airdcpp-web.github.io/docs/general/reporting-issues.html

## Posting a feature request?

Unless it's totally obvious, it's always good to explain your user case and why the requested feature is needed. Features with good reasoning are much more likely to get implemented.

## Making a pull request?

All pull requests should be submitted to the `develop` branch.
